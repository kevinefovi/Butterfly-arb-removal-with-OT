SSVi calibratgion fits a equation so that a smooth, continuous IV surface is procured from raw quotes.
This fit follows 5 parameters, making it strict in shape w/ vega-weighted weights so ATM (liquid) points matter more

Idea is to implement OT inspired weights so that quotes at tails aren't underfit, causing parameter whipsaw and increasing error
This hopefully will produce better fitted wings at little to no cost ATM
